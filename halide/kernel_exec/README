This example uses the kernel generated by Halide and executes it in the same
way of Halide runtime functions.

The kernel can be obtained by changing a few lines of code in the Halide source
code or by defining HL_DEBUG_PIPELINE when compiling ahead of time.

The host code was based on the runtime functions in the Halide source code
