halide
======
This directory contains programs created using Halide

  * batch-lenet - runs the a classifier using the lenet architecture
  * convolution2d - test program to illustrate how to do convolutions using RDom
  * simple-cnn - CNN using the LeNet architecture for classifying MNIST digits
  * aot_gpu - test program to illustrate how to compile ahead of time using GPU
  * kernel_exec - exemplifies the kernel and host code executed by Halide when running aot_gpu

batch-lenet
===========
The code to generate each of the layers are provided. Program mnist_cnn should aot compile an
mnist pipeline (parameters may have to first be extracted and stored in the associated project
folder in the data directory. for ease, there is compressed file containing some parameters in
the mnist project folder of the data directory). aot_test and aot_time can be used to test
and time with the resulting output. jit_time can be used to time the classification time for a
jit-compiled pipeline.
