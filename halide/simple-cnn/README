There are two executables generated, "generate_cnn" and "run_cnn".

"generate_cnn" can be built with the command "make".
When you run this executable, it will use Halide's compile_to_file
feature to create "Compiled_Pipeline.h" and "Compiled_Pipeline.o".

After the generated files are available, "run_cnn" can be built
with the command "make run". This links the generated pipeline
to a wrapper application.

The code to generate the cnn is in "cnn.cpp".
The code to run the pipeline is in "main.cpp".
