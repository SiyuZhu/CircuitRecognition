 A simple example of Halide using the GPU, more information is presented at
the Halide repository tutorials.

It's a simple convolution example that can be compiled for CUDA, OpenCL and
CPU, the default feature is OpenCL.

To generate the Halide function just type 'make' or 'make <gen_cuda|gen_cpu>',
to generate the program type 'make <opencl|cuda|cpu>'.

If you need to see the API calls made during execution set the variable HDEBUG
during the pipeline compilation to 'HDEBUG=-D__PIPEDEBUG__'.
